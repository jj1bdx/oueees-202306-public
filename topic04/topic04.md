# Is cloud really a uniform and single entity?

---

![original fit](Cloud_Computing-slide.jpg)

# Absolutely not: it's an intertwined *network* of computers

---

![right fit](kyoto-u-hpc-20170425.jpg)

# Web services are clusters of computers and networks

Thousands or millions of servers connected together

A physical server is separated into multiple virtual machines

---

# Cloud computing *is* centralization

# An example of cloud computing: Internet of Things (IoT) and telemetering

![original fit](telemetering.jpg)

---

# Telemetering

* Mostly unidirectional (not really *the true and genuine internet*)
* Sensors/devices gathering data through internet and feed them to the servers in the cloud computing platforms
* *The servers compute*
* *Extremely centralized*

# [fit] Social implication of cloud computing

<!-- talk contents here -->
## Centralized social behavior accerelated by cloud computing

* Sharing *everything* - no privacy
* *Panopticon* [^1] style of governance, filtering, *censorship, or autocracy*
* Complete *externalization* of resources, leading to *no personal control*

[^1]: n. a circular prison with cells arranged around a central well, from which prisoners could at all times be observed. (New Oxford American Dictionary, Apple macOS 10.13.6)

# INGSOC: the slogans [^2]

* War is peace
* Freedom is slavery
* Ignorance is strength

* Independent thinking = *thoughtcrime*

## NOTE: this is a *fiction*!

[^2]: George Orwell, "Nineteen Eighty-Four", 1949.

# Historical examples of INGSOC-like nations

* Nazi Germany [^3]
* Empire of Japan [^4] (Japan in 1868-1947)
* Soviet Union [^5] 
* ... you can pick up many nations currently existing

# [fit] Why cloud computing has become
# [fit] so *dystopian*?

---

# We have sold freedom for *convenience*

* Ubiquitous/global accessibility
* Concentrated data for easy analysis
* Easy control of the information flow
* No extra cost for sharing
* No need to think about where the information locates
* A useful tool for fascist and despotic regimes

---

# The inconvenient truth of centralized systems: what if the core/cloud fails?

![right](When-core-fails.png)

---

## Inconvenience of centralized systems

* Ubiquity or *no accessibility*
* When the core fails, no alternative
* When the core loses data, *no backup*
* The system performance is restricted by the capability of the core
* Endpoint systems will lost *all capabilities*

---

# Centralized systems are *not* sustainable

## ...then how cloud computing systems manages the sustainability?

---

# Distributed systems provide sustainability and resilience against failures
